# Studio Templates

Studio Templates is a place where we keep our REFramework templates. 

## Installation

They should always be in the latest version of Studio. 
Otherwise, you can simply clone this repo and use the templates from here.

## Usage

Remember: A "Template" project cannot be uploaded to Orchestrator. 

If you cloned this repository (instead of using the template from Studio):
1. Open the nuget that comes with the template
2. Otherwise, copy the project into a new *process* and don't use the *template* you cloned. It is not a normal *process*.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## License
Mixed. See each project individually.
