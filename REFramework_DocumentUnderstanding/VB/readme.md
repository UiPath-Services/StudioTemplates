## Installation

They should always be in the latest version of Studio. 
Otherwise, you can simply clone this repo and use the templates from here.

## Usage

Remember: A "Template" project cannot be uploaded to Orchestrator. 

If you cloned this repository (instead of using the template from Studio):
1. Open the nuget that comes with the template
2. Otherwise, copy the project into a new *process* and don't use the *template* you cloned. It is not a normal *process*.
