# Notes

- This process you see here is a 'template' type project in UiPath Studio. As such, if you downloaded it directly from git,
it is recommended you publish it manually to a nuget or copy/paste everything in a process.

- You should be able to get this from the official feed in UiPath Studio as well, and that is the recommended way to use this.
