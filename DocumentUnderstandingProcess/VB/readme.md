# Usage
If you want, you can add your API key from https://cloud.uipath.com and run the process 
from 'Main - Attended' file. This will use a sample merged file and show classification, extraction, and data saving.

For an actual project, you will have to modify this xaml for your own process.

# Notes

- This process you see here is a 'template' type project in UiPath Studio. As such, if you downloaded it directly from git,
it is recommended you publish it manually to a nuget or copy/paste everything in a process.

- You should be able to get this from the official feed in UiPath Studio as well, and that is the recommended way to use this.
